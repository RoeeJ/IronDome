# Hit Rate Fix Summary

## Issue: 0% Hit Rate

### Fixes Applied:

1. **Fixed UnifiedTrajectorySystem Mode Configuration**
   - The singleton was always using 'basic' mode
   - Now checks `__useImprovedAlgorithms` and updates mode accordingly
   - File: `src/systems/UnifiedTrajectorySystem.ts`

2. **Increased Proximity Fuse Detonation Radius**
   - Was: 5m detonation radius with 30m arming distance
   - Now: 8m detonation radius with 20m arming distance
   - This gives more margin for interception
   - File: `src/entities/Projectile.ts`

3. **Fixed Interceptor Guidance**
   - Reduced max G-force from 40G to 20G
   - Added smooth gain scaling (0.5 to 2.0)
   - Added velocity-based damping
   - Guidance cutoff at 5m (allows proximity fuse to work)
   - File: `src/entities/Projectile.ts`

4. **Added Comprehensive Debug Logging**
   - ProximityFuse now logs all decisions
   - Projectile guidance logs distances and forces
   - Enable with `?debug` URL parameter

## To Test:

1. Run `bun dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000?debug`
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Launch automatic interceptions
5. Check console for debug messages:
   - Look for [ARMED] messages
   - Check [PROXIMITY CHECK] distances
   - Watch for [DETONATION] or [NO DETONATION] messages

## Expected Debug Output:

```
[ProximityFuse] [UPDATE] Distance traveled: 25.3m, Distance to target: 15.2m, Armed: false
[ProximityFuse] [ARMED] Armed at distance: 20.1m
[Projectile] [GUIDANCE] [UPDATE] Distance to target: 12.5m, Speed: 150.2 m/s
[ProximityFuse] [PROXIMITY CHECK] Distance to target: 7.8m (within 8.0m radius)
[ProximityFuse] [DETONATION] Detonation at 7.8m, quality: 85%
```

## If Still Not Working:

Check the debug logs for:
1. Are fuses arming? (20m travel distance required)
2. Are interceptors getting within 8m of targets?
3. Is guidance working properly (distances decreasing)?
4. Are proximity checks happening every 2ms?

Based on the debug output, we can make further adjustments to fix any remaining issues.
