## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Environmental Systems

#### Weather System

  - Gameplay: Reduces radar detection range by 10-30%
  - Performance: Affects interceptor accuracy (-5% to -15%)
  - Atmosphere: Darker lighting, wet ground reflections

- **Fog/Mist**
  - Visual: Volumetric fog with variable density
  - Gameplay: Severely limits visual range
  - Radar: Less affected but still -5% to -10% range
  - Strategic: Forces reliance on radar over visual

- **Sandstorms** (Desert Maps)
  - Visual: Brownish particle clouds
  - Gameplay: Reduces all detection by 20-40%
  - Damage: Slight wear on interceptor stocks
  - Duration: 30-90 seconds

- **Wind System**
  - Affects projectile trajectories
  - Variable strength and direction
  - Visual: Particle drift, smoke trail bending
  - Strategic: Must compensate in targeting

#### Day/Night Cycle
- **Dawn** (05:00-07:00)
  - Gradual lightening, orange/pink sky
  - Reduced visibility initially
  - Thermal signatures more visible

- **Day** (07:00-17:00)
  - Full visibility
  - Heat shimmer effects
  - Shadow movement

- **Dusk** (17:00-19:00)
  - Golden hour lighting
  - Gradually reducing visibility
  - Beautiful but challenging

- **Night** (19:00-05:00)
  - Requires night vision or thermal
  - Tracer rounds more visible
  - City lights as targets
  - Searchlight mechanics

### 2. Audio Design

#### Essential Sound Effects
