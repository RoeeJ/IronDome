# Interception System Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Low Hit Rate Fix (14.5% â†’ Expected ~90%)
**Problem**: UnifiedTrajectorySystem singleton was defaulting to 'basic' mode instead of respecting the global `__useImprovedAlgorithms` setting.

**Solution**: Modified `UnifiedTrajectorySystem.calculateInterceptionPoint()` static method to:
- Check the global `__useImprovedAlgorithms` setting
- Update singleton mode to match ('improved' when true, 'basic' when false)
- Ensures correct trajectory calculations for automatic interceptions

**Code Changed**: `src/systems/UnifiedTrajectorySystem.ts` lines 305-314

### 2. Interceptor Looping Fix
**Problem**: Interceptors were oscillating/looping when approaching targets due to aggressive guidance corrections.

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Added close-range cutoff**: Stop guidance when < 5m from target
2. **Smooth gain scaling**: Changed from binary (2 or 3) to smooth scaling (0.5 to 2.0)
3. **Added damping factor**: Reduces corrections when closing velocity is high (> 100 m/s)
4. **Reduced max G-force**: From 40G to 20G to prevent aggressive maneuvers

**Code Changed**: `src/entities/Projectile.ts` lines 536-553

## Expected Improvements

1. **Hit Rate**: Should return to ~90% as the improved trajectory calculations are now properly used
2. **Interceptor Behavior**: Smooth approach to targets without oscillation
3. **Visual Quality**: More realistic interceptor flight paths

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the development server: `bun dev`
2. Launch automatic interceptions and observe:
   - Hit rate in stats panel (should be 85-95%)
   - Interceptor flight paths (should be smooth, no loops)
   - Proximity detonations (should occur reliably)

## Technical Details

The UnifiedTrajectorySystem now properly switches between modes:
- **Basic Mode**: Original TrajectoryCalculator algorithms
- **Improved Mode**: ImprovedTrajectoryCalculator with better lead prediction

The guidance system now uses:
- Proportional gain: `gain = max(0.5, min(2.0, distance / 25))`
- Damping: `dampingFactor = closingVelocity > 100 ? 0.7 : 1.0`
- Force limit: 20G maximum acceleration
