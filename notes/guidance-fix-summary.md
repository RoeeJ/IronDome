# Guidance System Fix Summary

## Critical Issues Found

From the debug logs, interceptors were:
1. **Orbiting at 23-29m** from targets (never getting within 8m detonation radius)
2. **Moving AWAY from targets** (negative closing velocities of -35 m/s)
3. **Flying too slowly** (75-80 m/s instead of 150+ m/s)

## Root Causes

1. **Wrong thrust direction**: Thrust was applied in current velocity direction, perpetuating circular motion
2. **Incorrect closing rate calculation**: Sign was inverted
3. **Insufficient correction when moving away**: No aggressive correction for negative closing rates
4. **Detonation radius too small**: 8m was insufficient given guidance accuracy

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Pure Pursuit Guidance
- Changed from proportional navigation to pure pursuit
- Aim directly at predicted target position
- Allow speed boost up to 200 m/s

### 2. Correct Thrust Direction
- Thrust now applies towards target (line-of-sight), not current velocity
- Target speed increased to 180 m/s
- Stronger acceleration (2x mass) with 30G cap

### 3. Aggressive Course Correction
- Higher gain when far (3.0 for distances > 50m)
- 1.5x damping factor when moving away from target
- Fixed closing rate calculation (positive = closing)

### 4. Increased Proximity Fuse Range
- Detonation radius: 8m → 15m
- Optimal radius: 3m → 5m
- Arming distance: 20m → 15m

## Expected Behavior

Interceptors should now:
1. **Accelerate towards targets** instead of orbiting
2. **Reach 180 m/s** cruise speed
3. **Detonate within 15m** of targets
4. **Show positive closing rates** in debug logs

## Debug Output to Watch For

Good signs:
```
[CONTROL] Closing rate: 120.5 m/s (positive = closing)
[THRUST] Current speed: 150.0 m/s, Target: 180 m/s
[PROXIMITY CHECK] Distance: 14.2m, Within range: true
[DETONATION] Detonation at 14.2m, quality: 71%
```

Bad signs (should be fixed):
- Negative closing rates
- Distances stuck at 23-29m
- Speed below 100 m/s
