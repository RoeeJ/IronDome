## Why These Were Archived

These documents represent completed work or outdated planning. The current state of the project has evolved beyond these documents:

1. **Implementation notes** describe work that has been successfully integrated
2. **Test results** are from earlier development phases
3. **Roadmap files** have been superseded by current status documents

For current project status, see:
- `/roadmap/ROADMAP_STATUS_2025.md` - Current ~80% completion
- `/roadmap/REMAINING_WORK.md` - What's actually left
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Current implementation guide
