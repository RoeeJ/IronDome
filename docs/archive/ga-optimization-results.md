# Genetic Algorithm Optimization Results - Proximity Fuse Settings

## Executive Summary

Using a genetic algorithm focused on maximizing kill probability (not just hit rate), we've discovered the optimal proximity fuse settings for the Iron Dome interceptor system.

## Optimal Settings (GA Result)

- **Arming Distance**: 20m  
- **Detonation Radius**: 10m
- **Optimal Radius**: 3m
- **Scan Rate**: 5

## Performance Metrics

### Kill Effectiveness
- **Overall Kill Rate**: 99.9%
- **Single-Shot Kill Rate**: 78.5% (average across all threat types)
- **Interceptors per Kill**: 1.27 (average)

### Per Threat Type Performance

| Threat Type | Speed (m/s) | Single-Shot Kill | Total Kill | Interceptors/Kill |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|------------|-------------------|
| Ballistic   | 162         | 80.0%           | 100%       | 1.23              |
| Drone       | 30          | 80.5%           | 99.5%      | 1.29              |
| Mortar      | 94          | 77.0%           | 100%       | 1.29              |
| Cruise      | 200         | 76.5%           | 100%       | 1.26              |

## Key Findings

### 1. Detonation Radius Sweet Spot
The analysis shows a clear optimal range for detonation radius:
- **4-5m**: Too tight, many misses (53-84% kill rate)
- **6-8m**: Good balance (98.5-99.5% kill rate, 1.37-1.96 interceptors/kill)
- **9-11m**: Optimal zone (100% kill rate, 1.20-1.25 interceptors/kill)
- **12-15m**: Diminishing returns (100% kill rate but 1.27-1.33 interceptors/kill)

### 2. Kill Probability vs Hit Rate
The GA optimization revealed that maximizing kill probability is more important than hit rate:
- A 100% hit rate with 75% kill probability requires 1.33 interceptors per kill
- An 85% hit rate with 85% kill probability requires only 1.20 interceptors per kill

### 3. Optimal/Detonation Ratio
The optimal radius should be approximately 30% of the detonation radius:
- This allows the interceptor to wait for ideal detonation distance when possible
- But still detonates at maximum range if necessary

## Comparison with Current Settings

| Setting | Current | GA Optimized | Improvement |
|---------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Arming Distance | 10m | 20m | Better safety margin |
| Detonation Radius | 6m | 10m | +67% engagement envelope |
| Optimal Radius | 3m | 3m | No change (already optimal) |
| Single-Shot Kill | ~65% | 78.5% | +20% effectiveness |
| Interceptors/Kill | ~1.5 | 1.27 | -15% interceptor usage |

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Update Proximity Fuse Settings**:
   ```typescript
   PROXIMITY_FUSE_SETTINGS = {
     armingDistance: 20,
     detonationRadius: 10,
     optimalRadius: 3,
     scanRate: 5
   }
   ```

2. **Benefits**:
   - 20% improvement in single-shot kill probability
   - 15% reduction in interceptor usage
   - Better performance against all threat types
   - Larger engagement envelope for guidance errors

3. **Trade-offs**:
   - Slightly larger detonation radius means interceptors detonate ~6m from target on average
   - This is still well within the effective blast radius for reliable kills

## Future Optimization Opportunities

The genetic algorithm framework can now be applied to optimize:
1. **Guidance Parameters**: Proportional gain, max acceleration, turn rates
2. **Battery Coordination**: Firing policies, target assignment algorithms
3. **Launch Timing**: Optimal delay between salvos
4. **Threat Prioritization**: Weighting factors for different threat characteristics

## Conclusion

The genetic algorithm successfully found proximity fuse settings that improve single-shot kill probability by 20% while reducing interceptor usage by 15%. The optimal settings balance the competing demands of hit probability, kill effectiveness, and resource efficiency.
