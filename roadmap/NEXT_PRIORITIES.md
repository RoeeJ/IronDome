## üéÆ Priority 2: Content & Scenarios
Structured gameplay gives purpose and replayability to the simulation.

### Scenario System Design
```typescript
interface Scenario {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard' | 'extreme'
  waves: Wave[]
  objectives: Objective[]
  constraints: Constraints
  scoring: ScoringRules
}

interface Wave {
  delay: number
  threats: ThreatConfig[]
  message?: string
}
```

### Initial Scenario Pack
1. **Training Scenarios** (3 scenarios)
   - "First Contact" - Single threats, learn basics
   - "Multiple Targets" - Handle 2-3 simultaneous threats
   - "Saturation Defense" - Survive escalating waves

2. **Historical Scenarios** (3 scenarios)
   - "Operation Pillar of Defense" - 2012 conflict patterns
   - "Guardian of the Walls" - 2021 threat types
   - "Southern Command" - Typical Gaza border defense

3. **Challenge Scenarios** (4 scenarios)
   - "Rocket Rain" - Continuous barrage test
   - "Mixed Threats" - Rockets, mortars, and drones
   - "Limited Resources" - Only 10 interceptors
   - "Perfect Defense" - Achieve 100% interception

### Implementation Timeline
- Week 1: Scenario system architecture
- Week 2: First 5 scenarios
- Week 3: Remaining scenarios + balancing
- Week 4: Scoring and leaderboards

## üîä Priority 3: Audio System
Sound dramatically increases immersion and provides crucial feedback.

### Audio Architecture
```typescript
class AudioManager {
  private context: AudioContext
  private sounds: Map<SoundType, AudioBuffer>
  private positionalSounds: Map<string, PannerNode>
  
  play3D(type: SoundType, position: Vector3, options?: AudioOptions)
  playUI(type: SoundType, volume?: number)
  setMasterVolume(level: number)
  muteCategory(category: AudioCategory)
}
```

### Sound Library Requirements
1. **Launch Sounds**
   - Iron Dome launch (whoosh + mechanical)
   - Threat launch (rocket ignition)
   - Multiple variants for variety

2. **Flight Sounds**
   - Interceptor motor burn
   - Threat whistling
   - Doppler effects

3. **Explosion Sounds**
   - Interception explosion
   - Ground impact
   - Debris impacts
   - Distance-based variations

4. **UI/Alert Sounds**
   - Red Alert siren
   - Target lock confirmation
   - Low ammo warning
   - Success/failure chimes

5. **Ambient Sounds**
   - Wind (affects audio perception)
   - Distant explosions
   - Radio chatter (optional)

### Implementation Approach
1. Use Web Audio API for 3D positioning
2. Implement audio pooling for performance
3. Dynamic range compression for mobile
4. Subtitle option for accessibility

## üèä Priority 4: Object Pooling System
Essential for maintaining performance with many objects.

### Pool Architecture
```typescript
class ObjectPool<T> {
  private available: T[] = []
  private inUse: Set<T> = new Set()
  
  constructor(
    private factory: () => T,
    private reset: (obj: T) => void,
    private initialSize: number
  ) {}
  
  acquire(): T | null
  release(obj: T): void
  preWarm(count: number): void
  stats(): PoolStats
}
```

### Pooling Targets
1. **Projectiles** (High Priority)
   - Pool size: 50 threats, 30 interceptors
   - Reset: Clear trails, reset physics

2. **Particle Systems** (High Priority)
   - Pool size: 20 explosion systems
   - Reset: Clear particles, reset emitters

3. **Audio Sources** (Medium Priority)
   - Pool size: 20 3D sources
   - Reset: Stop playback, clear buffer

4. **UI Elements** (Low Priority)
