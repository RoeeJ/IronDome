# Remaining Work - Iron Dome Simulator

## Project Status: ~80% Complete

The Iron Dome Simulator is largely feature-complete with full mobile support, city generation, and sophisticated gameplay. This document outlines the remaining ~20% of work needed to reach v1.0.

## 🎯 Priority 1: Audio Assets (1 week)
**Status**: System complete, assets missing

### Required Sound Files (~20 total)

```

### Implementation Notes
- SoundSystem.ts is fully implemented with 3D positional audio
- Volume categories: Master, Effects, UI, Ambient
- Distance attenuation and doppler effects ready
- Just needs audio files in the correct paths

## 🎮 Priority 2: Scenario Integration (3-4 days)
**Status**: Scenarios defined, not wired to gameplay

### Tasks
1. **Wire AttackScenarios.ts to WaveManager**
   - Connect scenario patterns to wave generation
   - Implement timing and intensity curves
   - Add scenario-specific threat mixes

2. **Create Scenario Selection UI**
   - Main menu scenario picker
   - Difficulty selection (Easy/Normal/Hard/Extreme)
   - Scenario descriptions and previews

3. **Victory/Defeat Conditions**
   - City damage threshold for defeat
   - Wave completion for victory
   - Score calculation based on efficiency

4. **Scenario Presets to Implement**
   - Training (tutorial mode)
   - Border Skirmish (light attacks)
   - Urban Assault (mixed threats)
   - Massive Barrage (stress test)
   - Drone Swarm (specialized defense)
   - Ballistic Rain (long-range threats)

## 🔄 Priority 3: Complete Object Pooling (2-3 days)
**Status**: Partial implementation (particles only)

### Extend Pooling To
1. **Projectiles**
   - Pool Threat instances by type
   - Pool Interceptor instances
   - Reuse trail renderers

2. **UI Elements**
   - Pool damage numbers
   - Pool threat indicators
   - Pool text meshes

3. **Audio Sources**
   - Pool positional audio sources
   - Limit concurrent sounds

### Benefits
- Eliminate GC spikes during combat
- Smoother performance on mobile
- Support for larger battles

## 🌦️ Priority 4: Weather Gameplay (2 days)
**Status**: Visual effects done, gameplay integration pending

### Implementation
1. **Wind Effects on Trajectories**
   - Apply wind force to projectiles
   - Vary by altitude (stronger higher up)
   - Visual wind direction indicator

2. **Rain Effects**
   - Reduce visibility/radar range
   - Affect interception accuracy
   - Add rain particle effects

3. **Fog Conditions**
   - Limited visual range
   - Delayed threat detection
   - Strategic gameplay changes

## 🎨 Priority 5: Polish & Edge Cases (1 week)

### Visual Polish
- [ ] Improved explosion shaders
- [ ] Better building damage states
- [ ] Enhanced trail effects
- [ ] Victory/defeat animations
- [ ] Loading screen tips

### Bug Fixes
- [ ] Handle WebGL context loss gracefully
- [ ] Fix any remaining mobile layout issues
- [ ] Resolve edge cases in battery coordination
- [ ] Clean up any memory leaks

### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome (Desktop & Mobile)
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari (macOS & iOS)
- [ ] Edge

### Performance Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with 100+ simultaneous threats
- [ ] Verify mobile performance limits
- [ ] Profile and optimize bottlenecks
