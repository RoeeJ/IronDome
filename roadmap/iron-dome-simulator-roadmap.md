- **Immediate Focus**: Remove React template, set up Three.js scene

## Technology Stack
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js
- **Physics Engine**: Cannon-es (recommended for easier integration)
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JS for core simulation, React for UI controls
- **Build Tool**: Bun's built-in bundler (already configured)
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **State Management**: Custom event system (EventBus pattern)
